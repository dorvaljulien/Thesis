\section{Approaching the N-body simulations}

After the previous analytical study, we present here the characteristics of  numerically obtained Hubble-Lema\^itre fragmented models. The integration was performed with NBODY6, which treats the gravitational forces of stars with no softening of the potential. An example of the evolution of the system is shown on Fig~\ref{Fig:2_fragmentation}. 



\begin{figure}[h]

The left panel shows the initial uniform sphere; the middle panel, an intermediate step, slightly fragmented with a slowed down expansion; the right panel is the final stage, when the expansion has stopped and the fragmentation is fully developed. N=10000 particles were used in this N-body model, with $\Hub_0 = 1.0$. Time and coordinates are in H\'enon units.}

\subsection{Presentation of the runs}

We draw $N$ stars from an Salpeter distribution function which we truncate by default to $100 M_\odot$~; in some calculations we will  use a lower bound of $20 M_\odot$, and in others we use identical masses. The code preserves the total energy and angular momentum to better than one part in $10^4$ for integration over $\sim 100 $ time units.  

\subsection{Clump finding algorithm}

As seen on Fig~\ref{Fig:2_fragmentation}, once expansion stops, the distribution is roughly spherical and visibly clumpy. By clump we mean here a local overdensity of stars. To characterize the model is to characterize these substructures. Such analysis requires to find and isolate clumps, using an efficient clump-identification algorithm (or, {\it halo-finding} in cosmology).  Several methods are commonly used such as the HOP algorithm \citep{Eisenstein1998,Skory2010} which relies on attributing local densities to each particle and separating the clumps through density thresholds. The HOP algorithm is very robust on large cosmological data sets. However, our calculations have comparatively coarse statistics and noisy density fields. This issue, coupled with the  large number of free parameters of the HOP algorithm, makes the method less appealing. 

Instead we follow \cite{Maschberger2010} who adapted the minimum spanning tree (MST~; see e.g.\citealt{Allison2009b,Olczak2011}) technique to the detection of clumps. A spanning tree is a set of edges connecting a group of  particles but without closed loops~; the MST seeks to minimise the total length of the edges. One may then construct the MST for the whole system, and then delete all edges larger than a chosen cutting length, $d_{cut}$. The sub-sets that are still connected  are labeled as clumps. This process is illustrated in Fig \ref{Fig:2_MST}. In practice a minimum sub-set size $N_d$  is also chosen so as to avoid many small-N subgroups~: experience led us to choose  $N_d = 12$ for the minimum number of stars per clump. 

\begin{figure}[h]

\end{center}
\caption{Illustration of a Minimum Spanning Tree and its use to isolate subgroups, using a cutting length $d_{cut}$.}
\label{Fig:2_MST}
\end{figure}


With $N_d$ fixed, the length $d_{cut}$ is then the only free parameter left. There is some freedom 
in choosing an appropriate value. \cite{Maschberger2010} fixed the value of  $d_{cut}$ by visual inspection of clumps.  We instead  identified  clumps in a fragmented system for a range of values for $d_{cut}$ and settled for the value  which optimised the number of identifications. This is shown on Fig.~\ref{Fig:2_Ndcut} for an N = 80k fully-fragmented Hubble model. For small $d_{cut}$'s, the number of detected clumps at first  increases rapidly. The rise is due  to the length $d_{cut}$ initially being small compared with the typical volume spawned by $N_d$ or more  nearest-neighbours. Beyond a certain value, a transition to another regime occurs, whereby the algorithm starts to connect previously separated clumps, counting them as one. The number of clumps thereafter begins to decrease. The value $d_{cut} \approx 0.024$ H.u optimises the outcome of the clump-search. This is a generic feature of the MST algorithm and we have adopted the same strategy throughout, adapting the value of $d_{cut}$ to the number $N$ of stars used.

\end{figure} 




Another method to find the critical cutting length was used by \cite{Gutermuth2009,Kirk2011}. In these works, the authors build the MST, then trace the cumulative distribution function of all edges in the tree. In a clumpy configuration, there are at least two regimes: the "intra-clump" regime, with the majority of small edges, and the "inter-clump" regime with longer, scarcer edges. The intersection of a fit to these regimes provide a good cutting length for clump detection. This procedure was applied to our system and gave the same result than the clump count, as shown on Fig~\ref{2_dcutcumulated}.

 
   On Fig.~\ref{Fig:2_clumpsABC}, a sub-set of the model is shown where we have identified stars that belong to clumps with filled symbols. The three panels on that figure are each for a different value of $d_{cut}$, increasing from top to bottom. For the smallest value $d_{cut}$=0.015 H.u, clumps look somewhat truncated as we are still in the under-sampling regime and only their cores registered as clumps. The second, optimal, value $d_{cut}$=0.025 H.u produces visually well-isolated clumps. Finally, the third and  largest value is so that clumps begin to merge together~: this is shown by the unique clump identified in the bottom panel (filled blue squares).
   
   
   
   
\section{Clump mass function}





\subsection{Influence of stellar mass function}
\label{Sec:ClumpMassFunction}





\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\caption{Summary of fragmentation models and their characteristics. These simulations started from an uniform sphere and were stopped when the expansion halted, at t=3 H.u . The third column shows the number of independent computations for each model.}
\label{Tab:2_fragmentationmodels}
\begin{tabularx}{0.7\textwidth}{XXXX}
\hline
Name & N & Sampling & Mass range  \\
\hline
Rmh20 & 15000 & 30 & [0.35- 20 ]\\
Rmh100 & 15000 & 30 & [0.3 - 100]\\
Rmh1 & 15000 & 30 & 1.0 \\
\hline
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}
\end{table}



We know the clumps are seeded by density fluctuations in the initial uniform sphere. These fluctuations are governed by pure Poisson noise in the case of identical stellar masses, but are modified and enhanced once stars follow a mass function themselves: a high-mass star surrounded by lighter ones will by itself introduce a localized strong density fluctuation.

We wish to quantify the relation of the clump- to  the {\it stellar} mass function in the generated initial conditions. To this end, we ran a set of simulations where all the stars have the same mass, and two sets for which a Salpeter mass function with $\alpha = 2.35$  was truncated at different upper- and lower-bounds. A total of 15000 stars in a Hubble configuration were used, all let go  with the same initial expansion rate  $\Hub_o = 1$. For the multi-mass models, the mass range  was chosen as $[0.3, 100]\, M_\odot$ and $[0.35, 20]\, M_\odot$ so that the mean stellar mass $= 1M_\odot$ as for the single-mass models. Thirty different runs were performed in each case and the outcome averaged for better statistics. These are refered to as Rmh1, Rmh100 and Rmh20 in Table \ref{Tab:2_fragmentationmodels}.

On Fig.~\ref{Fig:2_ClumpMF_MF}, we display the  number of clumps as function of clump mass for the truncated Salpeter  models as a red solid line, while the single stellar mass models are shown in green dash. A grey shade indicates one standard deviation where statistics allow ({\it i.e.}, large numbers), and we have used bins of constant logarithmic mass intervals.  Fig.~\ref{Fig:2_ClumpMF_MF_1} shows Rmh20 models, and \ref{Fig:2_ClumpMF_MF_2} shows Rmh100 models. 
With clump membership restricted to $N \geq 12$, the identical-mass model stays close to a power law (straight dotted line on the figure) of index $\approx -3$ down to the lowest clump mass of 12$M_\odot$. A spread in stellar masses leads to fewer low-mass clumps forming, which profits the  more massive ones (we counted $\simeq100$ clumps of $12 M_\odot$ for the equal-mass case~; and $\approx 32$ with a mass $ \le 12 M_\odot$ for the other ones) . This transforms the clump mass function, from a near-power-law, to a bell-shaped distribution.

The results for three stellar mass functions  are displayed~: a model with equal-mass stars (green dashed line)~; a Salpeter distribution function truncated at $20 M_\odot$ (solid red line, left)~; a Salpeter distribution function truncated at $100 M_\odot$(solid red line, right). (a) The clumps  mass function for equal-mass models  shows a trend with mass roughly in agreement with an $M^{-3}$ power-law. By comparison,  the results for an  Salpeter stellar distribution function  truncated at $20 M_\odot$ has a bell-shaped profile, with a peak around $M = 20.5 M_{\odot}$~; only the tail-end shows marginal agreement with an $\propto M^{-2}$ power-law (dotted line on the figure)~; (b) another Salpeter distribution function but with  the upper-mass truncation  set at $100 M_\odot$. The tail at large clump mass is now much flatter, with a slope $\approx M^{-1}$, (dotted line on the figure as well). The bins used  had constant logarithmic mass intervals.}
\label{Fig:2_ClumpMF_MF}
\end{figure}



When very massive stars are included in the calculations, yet more massive clumps are formed (Fig.~\ref{Fig:2_ClumpMF_MF_2}). The formation of large sub-structures depletes the number of clumps around the peak value, and so the distribution becomes broader and shallower. The mean clump mass for the different cases read $18 M_\odot$ (equal-mass), $30 M_\odot$ (Salpeter $m_{max} = 20 M_\odot$) and $42 M_\odot$ (Salpeter $m_{max} = 100 M_\odot$), a steady increase with the width of the stellar mass spectrum. On the other hand, the position of the peak of the distribution remains unchanged at (roughly) $20$ to $21M_\odot$. The trend in total number of clumps detected is a slight {\it de}crease with the broadening of the  stellar mass spectrum, from 166, down to 143 respectively for the $m_{max}=20$ and $100 M_\odot$ Salpeter models.  
%  Much of this difference in the  number of clumps is accounted in the 
 % range 0 to $20 M_\odot$, for which 73 and 54 clumps were found, respectively. 
% The fractional decrease of 26\% compares well with the lower number of stars in the interval 
% $[10,20]M_\odot$   for the model with the broader mass spectrum (which reaches $20\%$).  
  We observe that the overall fraction of  stars found in clumps (some $\approx 6500$ out of 15000, or 43\%) stays unchanged.
  
We argue that the shape of the clump mass spectrum provides indirect evidence for the role of massive stars predominantly as seeds for growth in our simulation, as opposed to the hierarchical build-up of  clumps from very tiny sub-structures. There are two tell-tale signs to support this view~: a) if high-mass clumps formed through the repeated and stochastic merger of smaller clumps, then the clump mass function should tend to a log-normal distribution, which is  symmetric (in logarithmic scales) with respect to the peak value, whereas the distributions shown here lack this basic property~; and b) the ratio of maximum clump mass to mean mass may exceed 15 when the  stellar truncation mass is set to $20\, M_\odot$, and reaches only $\sim 4$ in the case when the upper mass is set to $100\, M_\odot$. If small-ish clumps were merging at the same rate in both models, then this ratio should be comparable. Instead, very large clumps take too long to assemble and the merger rate drops with clump mass. Recall that all fragmentation calculations ran for the same total time. 

To check whether massive stars act as seeds in the simulation, we borrow from black hole dynamics in galactic nuclei the notion of a {\it radius of influence}, which is the radius  enclosing as much mass in the stars as the central black hole mass (see e.g. \citealt{Merritt2013}).  Here, the stars inside the influence radius are bound to the massive star at the centre. Thus if a massive star is a seed for a clump, and only the stars inside the influence radius remain bound to it, we should count as many clumps in the mass range $2m_\star, 2 m_\star + 2{\rm d}m_\star$, as there are stars in the range $m_\star, m_\star + {\rm d}m_\star$.  Because the maximum clump mass exceeds twice that of the most massive stars $m_{max}$, some degree of merging must take place. If we count all clumps starting from the truncation value $m_{max}$ of the stellar mass function,  
%presume that the clumps all formed from fragments seeded with a massive star and its cortege of bound stars, 
then we should find as many clumps in the mass range above $m_{max}$, as there are stars in the interval $[m_{max}/2, m_{max}]$.  We find for runs with $m_{max} = 20 M_\odot$ some $93$ clumps more massive than that, when there are $\simeq 100$ stars in the range $[10, 20] M_\odot$, essentially identical~; and some $11$ clumps of $100 M_\odot$ or more, when there are (on average) 9 stars in the mass range $[50, 100] M_\odot$. This calculation suggests that  most 
massive stars act as seeds for the formation of large clumps in the generated initial conditions.




\subsection{Influence of H and N}

Now that we know how the stellar mass function affects the seeding of the clumps, we can look at the influence of $\Hub_0$ and N on the subsequent fragmentation and clump growth. $\Hub_0$ tunes the strength of the expansion, which tunes the duration of the fragmentation. A stronger initial expansion allows for more time for clumps to grow, so we expect more massive clumps with increasing $\Hub_0$. On the other hand, a higher N only sample more stars from the same stellar mass function, and the density fluctuations should not change in nature, just scale down with the average distance between stars, we do not expect N to significantly affect the fragmentation. To verify these, a set of simulation was performed to explore the mass function of clumps in the $\Hub_0$-N parameter space. The models have 5 different memberships that go as powers of 2 in thousands, with an increasing sampling to obtain acceptable statistics:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|rrrrr}
\centering
N   & 1000 & 2000 & 4000 & 8000 & 16000\\ 
\hline
Sampling & 8 & 6 & 5 & 3 & 2\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Each one of these models were performed with 5 different $\Hub_0$:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|rrrrr}
$\Hub_0$ & 0.8 & 0.9 & 1.0 & 1.1 & 1.2
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
for a total of 120 different models ran up to the end of the expansion. The stars are taken from a Salpeter mass function with a $[0.3, 100] M_\odot$ mass range. The clump-finding algorithm was ran on the fragmented models to obtain the clump mass function. The results are summarised on figures \ref{Fig:2_ClumpMF_N} and \ref{Fig:2_ClumpMF_H}. As for the previous section, note that the number counts gets down to fractional values due to the averaging procedure. 

 The shape of the mass function is consistent with was was seen in previous section. Looking at the top panels of Fig~\ref{Fig:2_ClumpMF_N}, we see the mass function of clumps in \textit{relative} mass, the percentage of total mass they contain.  Clumps in small-N systems tends to contain a much larger portion of the total system mass than in large-N systems. In fact, for \tHub = 0.9, the peak of the mass function for N=1k happens at 1.3\% of total mass, while for N=16k, it happens at 0.08\%. These values ratio gives $\sim$ 16, the membership ratio: the clumps relative masses appears inversely proportional to the model's membership.
 
This can be interpreted as a underlying common clump distribution in physical mass, regardless of the total membership of the model. Such hypothesis is confirmed by looking at the bottom panels of Fig~\ref{Fig:2_ClumpMF_N}, in which clump distribution are plotted in physical mass, once the masses of stars have been rescaled from H\'enon units to match the stellar original mass function. It is clear that 1k and 16k models have the same clump distribution. The difference between \tHub = 0.8 and 1.2 is 
not clear from the graph, but it seems a higher \tHub pushes the upper limit of the distribution to slightly higher masses.

To check this last possible trend, we turn to Fig~\ref{Fig:2_ClumpMF_H} where clump MF are shown for various \tHub and a common membership. From left panel, N=1k, the only visible variation in the distributions appear to be a slight uptick in high masses for the strongest initial expansion, though the rest of the distribution is similar to all others. For N=16k, right panel, the distribution preserves its shape, and gets prolonged at higher clump masses, as more mass is available to build clumps.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth]{Figures/2_ClumpMF_N.png}

\caption{Clump mass function for several memberships and two $\Hub_0$. Masses in the top panels are in H\'enon units, the x-axis was scaled with a factor 100 to get a percentage of the total mass of the system. Bottom panel masses are in physical units. The mass functions were averaged over each membership sampling.}

\end{center}
\caption{Clump mass function (real mass) for several $\Hub_0$  and two memberships.}
\label{Fig:2_ClumpMF_H}
\end{figure} 


From these models, it is clear the clump distribution in a \HubLem  fragmented model is not strongly affected either by membership or by strength of expansion. The quasi non-existent dependency on \tHub is more surprising, as one could expect that a longer expansion allows more time for clumps to grow an attract stars, shifting the mass function to the right. 

A possible explanation is for high \tHub, the clumps have more time to form, but also need more time to do so as they fight a stronger "expansion pressure". Stars are distancing themselves faster when the initial expansion is strong, and gravitational convergence of density perturbations takes longer. These trends compensate to create a H-independant process.







\section{Clump contents}

In this section we compare the clump configurations derived from the \HubLem expansion method with the distribution of proto-stars that form in hydrodynamical simulations. We first look at the velocity field inside and outside the clumps, then we investigate the stellar content of the clumps themselves and their mass segregation.
We performed additional simulations to investigate higher memberships, summarized below:

\label{Fig:2_Vx_histogram}
\end{figure}




 There is no hydrodynamics in the approach that we have taken, nevertheless expansion under gravity alone is equivalent to the adiabatic expansion of gas~: for that case, the first law of thermodynamics equates the drop in internal energy ${\rm d}U$ to minus the external work,  $-p {\rm d}V$. At constant mass, the change in gravitational energy ${\rm d}W$ is $ - {\rm d}E_k$, where $E_k$ is the kinetic energy. With $W < 0 $ but increasing over time, this implies that $E_k$ drops in amplitude. In the case when the motion is strickly radial, $E_k = 0$ when $H = 0$ and all stars come to rest. We ask to what extent the growth of substructures and non-radial motion  off-set the `adiabatic cooling' brought on by expansion. 

Fig.~\ref{Fig:2_Vx_histogram_1} graphs the x-axis one-dimensional velocity distribution for a 40k-particle model. The left-hand panel displays the overall distribution as well as the two sub-populations of clumps members and out-of-clump \textit{field} stars. We identified some 20944 stars in clumps (or $\approx $ 52\%) at the end of expansion. The expectation that all stars have zero- or low-velocities is validated by the peak in the distribution around $v_x = 0$.

As sub-structures form and  interact mutually, generating tangential as well as radial motion, the peak broadens but remains symmetric about the origin.  The large velocities are brought by stars in clumps, which demonstrates that interactions within the substructures boost the internal velocity dispersion of the cluster as a whole. Field stars dominate the low-amplitude regime. Their velocity distribution is well-fitted with a  Gaussian (shown as a dotted blue line), down to one-tenth the height of the central peak, or about 1\% of all field stars. 

To illustrate further the idea that large velocities are confined to clumps formed by fragmentation modes, we compare on Fig.~\ref{Fig:2_Vx_histogram_2} a set of models 
with different initial  values of  $\Hub_o$: 0, 0.3, and 1. 
Clearly when $\Hub_o=0$, the velocities are identically zero and there is no fragmentation whatsoever (apart from root-N noise). The distribution is then a sharp peak centered on zero. For positive but low values of $\Hub_o$, the fragmentation modes do not develop much before the apex and the (non-radial) velocities remain small. The central peak  has a much narrower dispersion, and the high-velocity wings are clipped. In this case, too, analysis of the  weakly fragmented system shows that virtually all high-velocity stars are found in clumps. The velocity distribution for the case  $\Hub_o = 1$ is added for comparison. The fact that the full range in velocities is reduced by a factor $\sim 3$ for the 
less fragmented model is also an indication of the shallower potential well of the clumps

The full population velocity distribution (solid black line) at first sight is very similar to those of \citet[Fig.~5]{Klessen2000}. In that figure, the authors show the velocity distribution of gas particles in a fragmenting system. \citeauthor{Klessen2000} attribute the high-velocity tails to gas particles falling towards stellar clumps at supersonic speed. Supersonic motions imply that gas particles trace ballistic trajectories, and hence behave like point mass particles. 

A small fraction of field stars in our calculations also have large velocities. We suspected that these stars might have acquired their large velocity through in-fall toward a nearby stellar clump. We did not, however,  find compelling evidence that would allow us to identify the origin of high velocities in field stars. Inspection of a sequence of snapshots failed to show that the velocity vectors were pointing at nearby stellar clumps: it is therefore not possible to make the same assertion as \citeauthor{Klessen2000} and state that stellar clumps accrete field stars.

It is possible, on the other hand,  that high velocities originate from past star-star interactions. However, we did not find clear trends in the few orbits that we studied which would confirm such an event. The question of mass accretion by stellar clumps might be best settled if we added gas to our simulations to boost the mass resolution, and analysed model data using mock CCD frames, as did \citeauthor{Klessen2000}. This was not attempted here.

We close this section with a remark about the velocity distributions seen on Fig.~\ref{Fig:2_Vx_histogram} and the internal state of the stellar clumps. Because small clumps would have time to evolve dynamically through star-star collisions and reach a state of near-equilibrium (see \S\ref{Sec:Timescales}) we would expect clumps to develop a velocity field similar to Mitchie-King models of  relaxed self-gravitating star clusters \citep{BT}.  The one-dimensional velocity distribution of Mitchie-King models plotted in a logarithmic scale approaches a flat-top when $|v_{1d}|$ is small,  and cuts-off rapidly at large values~: the distributions are  concave at all velocities. This holds true for all models independently of their King parameter\footnote{Notice how this holds only because of the choice of a logarithmic vertical axis.} $W_0$. 

The shape of the distributions displayed on Fig.~\ref{Fig:2_Vx_histogram}, on the other hand, is convex as we shift, from small, to large $|v_{1d}|$. We deduce from this straightforward observation that the clumps that formed through fragmentation and subsequent mergers cannot be treated as fully in isolation and in dynamical equilibrium \`a la Mitchie-King.  Fragmentation in hydrodynamical calculations often proceeds from filaments and knots  (e.g., \citealt{Klessen2001,MacLow2004,Maschberger2010,Bate2014}). The clumps that form in a fragmenting  Hubble  flow are also surrounded by filaments and other structures which perturb them.
