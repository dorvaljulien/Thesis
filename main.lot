These simulations, performed with NBODY6, started from an uniform sphere and were stopped at the apex time, $t_a$, when the expansion halts. The third column shows the number of independent computations for each model. Stars are drawn from an Salpeter distribution with truncation values shown in the fourth column. All mass ranges preserve an average stellar mass of 1${\textrm {M}_\odot }$. Models that stops at 40 H.u starts from already fragmented configuration. The RunsHN runs are detailed in the two lower tables.\relax }}{48}{table.caption.32}
